      #
      # This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
      # configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
      # See <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/> for detailed information.
      # In particular, see
      # <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/directives.html>
      # for a discussion of each configuration directive.
      #
      # Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
      # what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
      # consult the online docs. You have been warned.
      #
      # Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
      # of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for Win32), the
      # server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
      # with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so 'log/access_log'
      # with ServerRoot set to '/www' will be interpreted by the
      # server as '/www/log/access_log', where as '/log/access_log' will be
      # interpreted as '/log/access_log'.

      #
      # ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
      # configuration, error, and log files are kept.
      #
      # Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point
      # ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the
      # Mutex directive, if file-based mutexes are used.  If you wish to share the
      # same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at
      # least PidFile.
      #
      ServerRoot "/opt/rh/httpd24/root/etc/httpd"

      #
      # Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
      # ports, instead of the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
      # directive.
      #
      # Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to
      # prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.

      # Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support

      # To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you
      # have to place corresponding `LoadModule' lines at this location so the
      # directives contained in it are actually available _before_ they are used.
      # Statically compiled modules (those listed by `httpd -l') do not need
      # to be loaded here.
      #
      # Example:
      # LoadModule foo_module modules/mod_foo.so

      Include conf.modules.d/*.conf

      # If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run
      # httpd as root initially and it will switch.
      #
      # User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run httpd as.
      # It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for
      # running httpd, as with most system services.

      # The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'

      # any <VirtualHost> containers you may define later in the file.
      #

      # in which case these default settings will be overridden for the

      #
      ServerAdmin root@localhost

      #
      # ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.
